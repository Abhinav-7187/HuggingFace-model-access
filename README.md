# HuggingFace-model-access

Demonstrating how we can access models from **Huggingface hub** through different techniques such as an **API** using the **"HuggingFaceEndpoints"** class.

And accessing models via **Huggingface pipeline** which is suitable for only smaller sized models because of resources constraint.
