# HuggingFace-model-access

Demonstrating how we can access models from **Huggingface hub** through different techniques such as through an **API** using the **"HuggingFaceEndpoints"** class OR

Accessing models via **Huggingface pipeline** where we can directly load the model into our working environment and can access them using their model_id but this technique is suitable only for smaller-sized models because of resources constraint.
